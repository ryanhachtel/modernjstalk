## Created for my talk at the 2019 Milliman Tech Forum
## Three Different versions of a TodoMVC Application
- JSAndReact: Regular React.js and ES6 JavaSCript
- TSAndReact: Typescript with regular React.js
- TSAndNewReact: Typescript with new React.js features like hooks/suspense/lazy

## Just Clone the repo, head to the folder you want to look at then NPM Install and run the dev script in the package.json
